# nomad 

Hey y'all! presenting you **Nomad** - a 3D printer that **turns into a suitcase** and can be carried anywhere.  
Yeah, you heard that right. A *foldable* 3D printer.  
So‚Ä¶ here we go!

*drumroll...* ü•Å  
**nomad!**

## What's Nomad?

**Nomad** is a Cartesian-style 3D printer with a folding mechanism that transforms it into a compact suitcase-sized form. It‚Äôs built to be *portable*, *functional*, and just plain cool.

### In its resting/original state:

You can spot the X, Y, and Z gantries, the bed, the extruder, a few motors, and this oddly shaped container ‚Äî which becomes the suitcase shell.

What‚Äôs happening here?

- The Z-axis protective covering is hinged ‚Äî so it flips up.
- The Y-gantry rides on **telescopic rails**, like kitchen drawers (yep, that‚Äôs where the idea came from lol), and slides outward.
- Once unfolded, it works just like a regular Cartesian 3D printer.

It‚Äôs *simple-ish*, modular.

I‚Äôm working on a full documentary showing the build process + final result. Will link it here as soon as I
finish building the physical version and
upload the full video to YouTube

## Special Note

This project wouldn't have been possible without **Hack Club**.

Not just the financial support (which was HUGE), but also the *environment* and *inspiration* from Hack Club‚Äôs awesome community.

Massive shoutout to **YSWS Infill** - the event that encouraged building unique and wild 3D printers.  
And to **Alex (@qcoral)** for organizing it all - you‚Äôre the GOAT. üêê
