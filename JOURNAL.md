# nomad
## nomad is a foldable bed slinger 3d printer which turns into a suitcase, everything made from scratch

Made by @Manan
Repository link - https://github.com/Manan-Coder/nomad

Total hours so far - 43 hours

Day 1 -
Did some research and found the suitable parts for now. Made some rough sketches to visualize the working and stared with cad-ing.
Research + sketching - 3 hours
Made the aluminum extrusion 2020 model - 2 hours

Day 2 -
Did some more research and finalized the build volume of 220x220x250mm as it is neither too massive nor too small, its just the ideal size under which I can print almost every daily object.
Made the inner frame which will form the structure and carry the gantry and rods, the frame is 340x340mm right now (X and Y axes, Z is still to be worked on).
Made hinge, joint models and fixed them their positions.
Total time taken - 4 hours

Day 3 -

Did some more research and finalized the build plate and heat bed of dimensions 235x235x3mm. Found 2020 extrusions, stepper motors, main board, extruder and hotend etc. and prepared a primary BOM.
Time: ~3 hours
![Initial BOM](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/2c8996a9d5132e9d5850e585b9bc4363e6546221_screenshot_2025-04-08_at_1.29.18___pm.png)

Completed the frame design, this took a lot of time as I had to iterate through the design a lot of times, this is because my printer's whole thing depends on the frame. Found a lot of problems in folding it and found even more solutions. For now the base design of the frame is done, minor changes will be there as I iterate through the design more.
Time: ~9 hours
![Frame v1](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/9c66486f2f446b9a6c1975bf1d7b179366465401_screenshot_2025-04-08_at_1.26.23___pm.png)


Completed the y-gantry, bed will ride on it, but the gantry itself will ride a clamp on a telescopic rail. This way it can be pulled out when to be used and pushed in when to be folded. This thing can be folded into a suitcase on paper right now, but god knows.....
Time: ~4 hours

Day 4 -
Completed the whole mechanism and structure of the printer, now just left with the protective outer abs sheet covering to give it a suitcase like look and save it from being damaged.
I polished the y-gantry and completed the x and z-gantry today, this included a lot of restructuring of the frame but atleast its done now, now tomorrow I can simply complete the protective covering, BOM, readme and put an end to the software part of this project. Now the real fun begins, HARDWARE!!!!
Also I tried taking a few cinematic shots for the documentary today (in most of the cases i failed brutally), but yeah this project seems okay-ish now. The biggest thing i've built so far lol.
Time: ~11 hours

Day 5 and 6 -
I was quite a lil ill on the 5th day so i didnt work much, i've finished the cad model tho, i was left with the outer protective frame which will save my printer from jerks and shocks. I earlier decided to use ABS plastic sheets but making a budget printer in this economy....... so finally inflation made humans use wood again, thats right, imm using wooden boards as my proectice layering now :p hmm im certainly in the budget(plss goddd plss i beg you).
Hours taken: ~7
Alright so the final renders of the printer looks smth like this -
**drumrolls*

# Build Journal


ok ok so now I swear to god im going to be consistent with build and i set a goal to get this printer printing things within next two weeks.

## day 1

ok so before this i made some really slow turtle like process, so like i set up some basic things and made some clamps for stepper motors and a few other things, cuz like they ones from the marketplaces were really expensive for broke me, so i made some wood working and glued the wooden parts together, and in middle out of nowhere i got a 3d printer, yeah, so i got a bambu labs a1 mini and that made my life a lot easier. I made a lot of parts off it and yeah life is good now.

so today i made this extruder setup with 3d printed bracket and even the screws and tnuts are 3d printed, isnt that cool?
