## nomad is a foldable bed slinger 3d printer which turns into a suitcase, everything made from scratch

Made by @Manan
Repository link - https://github.com/Manan-Coder/nomad

Total hours so far - 43 hours

Day 1 -
Did some research and found the suitable parts for now. Made some rough sketches to visualize the working and stared with cad-ing.
Research + sketching - 3 hours
Made the aluminum extrusion 2020 model - 2 hours

Day 2 -
Did some more research and finalized the build volume of 220x220x250mm as it is neither too massive nor too small, its just the ideal size under which I can print almost every daily object.
Made the inner frame which will form the structure and carry the gantry and rods, the frame is 340x340mm right now (X and Y axes, Z is still to be worked on).
Made hinge, joint models and fixed them their positions.
Total time taken - 4 hours

Day 3 -

Did some more research and finalized the build plate and heat bed of dimensions 235x235x3mm. Found 2020 extrusions, stepper motors, main board, extruder and hotend etc. and prepared a primary BOM.
Time: ~3 hours
![Initial BOM](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/2c8996a9d5132e9d5850e585b9bc4363e6546221_screenshot_2025-04-08_at_1.29.18___pm.png)

Completed the frame design, this took a lot of time as I had to iterate through the design a lot of times, this is because my printer's whole thing depends on the frame. Found a lot of problems in folding it and found even more solutions. For now the base design of the frame is done, minor changes will be there as I iterate through the design more.
Time: ~9 hours
![Frame v1](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/9c66486f2f446b9a6c1975bf1d7b179366465401_screenshot_2025-04-08_at_1.26.23___pm.png)


Completed the y-gantry, bed will ride on it, but the gantry itself will ride a clamp on a telescopic rail. This way it can be pulled out when to be used and pushed in when to be folded. This thing can be folded into a suitcase on paper right now, but god knows.....
Time: ~4 hours

Day 4 -
Completed the whole mechanism and structure of the printer, now just left with the protective outer abs sheet covering to give it a suitcase like look and save it from being damaged.
I polished the y-gantry and completed the x and z-gantry today, this included a lot of restructuring of the frame but atleast its done now, now tomorrow I can simply complete the protective covering, BOM, readme and put an end to the software part of this project. Now the real fun begins, HARDWARE!!!!
Also I tried taking a few cinematic shots for the documentary today (in most of the cases i failed brutally), but yeah this project seems okay-ish now. The biggest thing i've built so far lol.
Time: ~11 hours

Day 5 and 6 -
I was quite a lil ill on the 5th day so i didnt work much, i've finished the cad model tho, i was left with the outer protective frame which will save my printer from jerks and shocks. I earlier decided to use ABS plastic sheets but making a budget printer in this economy....... so finally inflation made humans use wood again, thats right, imm using wooden boards as my proectice layering now :p hmm im certainly in the budget(plss goddd plss i beg you).
Hours taken: ~7
Alright so the final renders of the printer looks smth like this -
**drumrolls*

# Build Journal


ok ok so now I swear to god im going to be consistent with build and i set a goal to get this printer printing things within next two weeks.

## day 1

ok so before this i made some really slow turtle like process, so like i set up some basic things and made some clamps for stepper motors and a few other things, cuz like they ones from the marketplaces were really expensive for broke me, so i made some wood working and glued the wooden parts together, and in middle out of nowhere i got a 3d printer, yeah, so i got a bambu labs a1 mini and that made my life a lot easier. I made a lot of parts off it and yeah life is good now.

so today i made this extruder setup with 3d printed bracket and even the screws and tnuts are 3d printed, isnt that cool?
![extruder](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/ccdaddb75bc4d16c617b8c59f4f0a58e7e344364_img_20250917_180349319__1_.jpg)
![extruder](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/efe60886d20e12e73e9163732ce4408b00bb9fab_img_20250917_180356047__1_.jpg)


so, after making that extruder thing properly, i printed a simple stepper motor mount, as they were really expensive at the online marketplace and i didnt have that much money to spend on them, so i made them myself.
So everything was going fine but the thing is that the motor has to be screwed on the mount and those screws come with the mount and not the motor, so i had no screws for it. I printed some m5 screws to screw the mount itself so i thought i can print some m3 switches too, but oh boy, the thing is that they are really thin compared to m5 ones and my printer is an open one so they warped, now i gotta go to some local shop in the morning and get some m3 screws.
(also i forgot to tell that one of those screws broke while screwed into two so now i gotta figure out to to get it out :sob:, some images of this testament )

![extruder](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/f04b1cec2d9a26fd08602bf7714ef10daa74339f_img_20250918_005615.jpg)

Yup, so i was free so i made the setup for filament to enter the extruder and find its way to the hotend, so i just setup the hotend, there wasnt much to setup in it but i realised that for some reason a tiny bulb like thing attached to one of the two wires of it was bulging out, so i had to dismantle it to figure out where it will go, once fixing it just ran the filament through it simulating the motor gear with my hand, no big deal - everything's working fine.

## day 2
yup so last night i setup the extruder and hotend, today i made some setup for screwing the extruder to the rail, it failed tho - i took wrong dimensions and didn't check before as i was tired af but yeah i got it how to make things like this, now i have my last sem exam tomorrow, after that im gonna rush the build and target finish to be done in under 1.5 weeks. Also yeah we finally getting the main board skr mini e3 v3 in a week or some. ah man getting this board here in india was hell, there is only one vendor who sells it and even they had it out of stock for the past 2.5 months, finally getting it now. ah

## day 3
ok so today im making a setup for extruder to completely ride the rail block. for this im cad modelling a structure with holes to be screwed with the rail, holes and platform to be screwed to the extruder and a lil structure at the top to be joined with the gt2 belt.

ok so the thing is that i was able to find a dimensions chart of the rail block so i just made the holes for screws according to it but i wasn't able to find one for the hotend holder as its just a acrylic cutout. So i took a measuring tape and tried to measure it the best i could, then i sketched it out on a cardboard piece and tried to screw it, once i was satisfied - i proceeded with cad, and as expected first few didnt succeed but the third print was able to satisfy the requirements. so yeah now we are done with the hotend setup too.
![hotend](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/904a5fbbfb7f58e1ebd6da66724fe38cd80eb2c0_img_20250925_230342.jpg)
![hotend](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/a9ace361c2c6393c3d68dbee315cc832a35c6671_img_20250925_223916947.jpg)
![hotend](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/6ceca505c6cf3a806e27b691e00402cea9a5c5b4_img_20250925_230454.jpg)

## day 4,5
ok so i made the things for the z axis, its done now, i cad modelled a setup for keeping the rods in place at the top first, so its just a strip with two holes for the rods to be inserted in. then i 3d printed it and yeah it indeed works well.
other than that i made clamp mounts for the nema stepper motors, i found a few online on printables.com etc. but they werent fulfilling the job as i want a 2 rod setup, so i cad modelled it from scratch and then printed, i made two models for it and then decided to stick with the second one.
then i made some test runs, so i just screwed it on the extrusion and then screwed in the motor, then i fixed the coupler on the motor head and put a threaded rod in it, and then i put a smooth normal rod in the other holder - and yeah it worked well.
so right now we have our z gantry complete, x 20% complete and y 50% complete.



## day 6
ok so we finally got the board, the skr mini e3 v3, the peak, so now the build is gonna go on full on speed, like we got everything now so there is no reason this thing can get delayed now. Today i setup some of the wires for it and then like made some circuits with the main power. I tried plugging it in the usd with my pc to test it out but it didnt really work for some reason, i found out some issues online regarding this thing and like the board sometimes just doesnt work with usb, so im gonna power it directly from power supply and flash in the firmware using a sd card. So i made the connections between the board and the power unit, the hotend and the heatbed and the motors. I still didnt power it as im getting a multimeter in like 2-3 days so like its better to be safe than your board going boom. so yeah. thats it. too much wires. lowkey got scared.
